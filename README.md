# rsCNN
Hey there, you've found rsCNN - our attempt to make a package that facilitates the use of CNNs in the context of remote sensing (or even large lab images).  This came as an extention of [ecoCNN](https://github.com/pgbrodrick/ecoCNN) (see [Uncovering ecological patterns with convolutional neural networks](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169534719300862?via%3Dihub)), but here we wanted to make things into more of a package that we could easily extend and modify.  So, if you've found you're way here, don't write much code, and want to pull read a more linearly written set of code, you might want to check out [ecoCNN](https://github.com/pgbrodrick/ecoCNN) (see [Uncovering ecological patterns with convolutional neural networks].  But if you're interested in *using* the package more, this is the place for you.

We welcome contributions by the community, and want everyone to have access to this - but we also want to be clear that it's a work in progress, not perfect, and evolving based on the projects we happen to be working on.  If you have particular feature requests, let us know, and if we can find time or they align with our interests, we'll try to add them in.

Cheers,

[Phil Brodrick](https://www.philbrodrick.com) and [Nick Fabina](http://nsfabina.github.io/)
